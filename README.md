 This is basic implementation of a cluster algorithm. The algorithm is custom and uses the plain english way of stating a fact as the cost.  And does a statistical comparison of the words/synonyms present to see if a statement matching the fact exists.  It then applies negation checking to do a rough estimate to see if the statement is positively or negatively correlated with the fact.
